## Assignment Overview
What is the assignment about?  
Explain the purpose of the program and what it accomplishes.

This assignment's goal was to solidify our learning and apply our knowledge of linked lists and stacks. We were required to
create many different linked lists and have them interact with each other to show the sequential processes of going through
linked lists especially transferring the head and next nodes to account for the new heads and nodes. This assignment accomplished making students effectively understand the importance of linked lists and stacks and why they are different from
each other.

## Implementation
Is the assignment complete? If not, mention what part of the assignment is missing or incomplete.

Yes the assignment is complete and all functions are working correctly. I wasn't able to account for the nitt-gritty error exceptions, but the basic invalid inputs/outputs/arguments are flagged appropriately. I tested all cases for q1 and they worked correctly and then I tested q2 with 2 cases that gave me correct solutions.
